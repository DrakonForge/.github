## DrakonForge Studios

We are a team of hobbyist game developers, currently creating [mods for Hytale](https://modtale.net/creator/DrakonForgeStudios)! Our specialty is in creating deep gameplay systems and designer-friendly tools to enable modders to create awesome experiences.

Our Hytale modding tenets are outlined below.

### Support Indie Modders

We aim to support modders who are not backed by large companies, and build up the community by helping people grow and learn together.

### Open Source

We strongly prioritize free open source mods, with copyleft licenses which favor other open-source projects. We believe open source mods are critical to building the community. They allow modders to learn and improve from each other, compared to closed source, private, and paid mods which gatekeep and silo information.

### No/Limited AI Use

While AI has limited applications for targeted research and pattern recognition, it is a tool with many pitfalls for those who cannot apply it without skilled oversight. It may provide faster results, but it harms your ability to learn and maintain your projects. Therefore, we can never recommend using AI, especially for inexperienced programmers, and avoid using it ourselves. AI-generated images are not art.
